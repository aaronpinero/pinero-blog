excerpt: Safari is finally coming aroundâ€¦ sort of.

<span class="dropcap">I</span>n working on my [Tyfy](http://aaronpinero.net/tyfy/docs/index.html) framework, I've rediscovered the `color-scheme` property in CSS. I wrote about this back in April of â€™24. I was frustrated that this very useful feature could not be used for developing dark mode in my custom Drupal themes because Safari didn't support the property â€“ and was actively breaking the stylesheet if you tried to use it instead of simply ignoring it.

Happy to say that it now works. This makes me giddy. I can remove duplicate color declarations for dark mode colors â€“ and stop using `prefers-color-scheme` media queries â€“ and write color definitions like this:

```
:root {
  --bg-color: light-dark(white, black);
}
```

ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©

In addition to the color-scheme goodness, I learned about another color property today: `accent-color`. This property affects the color applied to checkboxes, radio buttons, range sliders, and `<progress>` elements. I have yet to try it but I see on MDN that this property does not fully work with Safari.

Go figure.
