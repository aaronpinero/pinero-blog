<span class="dropcap">L</span>ast week's [Friday Front-End](https://fridayfrontend.com) newsletter linked to [an article](https://karuna.dev/colormaxxing/) that took me down a real rabbit hole. That article is a longer description of someone else having the same experience I'm describing here. I've figuratively (and perhaps literally) had my eyes opened to how color works, how to better work with color in CSS, and how to exploit a whole new set of colors on the web.

I'm referring to oklch color which (since May 2023) is widely supported in CSS. [This blog post from Evil Martians](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl) fully explains what oklch is and why we all want to be using it. They also created an [oklch color picker and converter](https://oklch.com/#70,0.1,51,100) web tool which I intend to use to get started moving my CSS colors from rgb and hsl.

Not only is oklch a better way of describing and manipulating colors in CSS, it also opens up the ability to describe colors outside of the RGB color space in the realms of P3 and wide color gamut â€“ and even colors for which there is not currently a display technology. I think this, for at least a little while, will help differentiate really great websites. They will be literally more vibrant than websites still using RGB colors.

For fun, I found a YouTube video from the Juxtopposed channel describing ["everything about color (literally)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srRI7yMjGz0). My wife was wondering if it's AI narrated, but I don't think so. And in the end it doesn't matter because the video is incredible.
