<span class="dropcap">A</span>n accessibility audit of one of my websites turned up an interesting problem. I have placeholder text in a form input. When the viewport is small, the placeholder text is cut off. This was reported as a failure of [success criterion 1.4.4 - Resizing text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-scale.html).

My first thought was to see if there was some way to make the placeholder text fit into the small space available inside the input at small viewport sizes. I was able to make this happen – sort of – in Chrome and Safari. It wouldn't work in Firefox (which is the browser the auditor is using). After some searching, I found a very helpful guide posted by Samantha Ming about [Styling Placeholder Text with CSS](https://www.samanthaming.com/tidbits/57-styling-css-placeholder/). The big takeaway from this article is the list of supported styles for placeholder text:

- background properties
- color
- font properties
- letter-spacing
- line-height
- opacity
- text-decoration
- text-indent
- text-transform
- vertical-align
- word-spacing

As you can see, position and text wrap are not among the available options. Looks like I will need to replace the placeholder text with some other sort of description – perhaps an [accessible tooltip](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tooltip_role).
