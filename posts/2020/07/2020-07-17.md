title: About SVG Images in Drupal

excerpt: How is it that we can’t have SVG images in 2020?

I am surprised and disappointed that, in 2020, the Drupal CMS doesn’t support SVG images by default. The image field in Drupal’s core only allows for the usual image suspects: JPEG, GIF, and PNG. Annoyingly, Drupal will let you specify, for an image field, that files with the SVG extension are allowed. But it won’t actually respect this setting or allow you to upload SVG images.

Fortunately, the generous folks at Third and Grove published [this very brief and helpful article](https://www.thirdandgrove.com/insights/svg-images-drupal-8/) on how to modify your Drupal theme to utilize a File field for SVG images. It works like a charm.
