excerpt: I’ve never been a gambler, and I have no intention of becoming one now.

<span class="dropcap">C</span>OVID-19 is complicated. As time goes on the ways in which it debilitates the people it infects become more varied. What was once a respiratory infection became a disease of the immune system and then a hazard to your nervous system. COVID-19 can cause people to lose their sense of smell, [suffer strokes, have their brain swell, and suffer long term neurological problems](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/08/warning-of-serious-brain-disorders-in-people-with-mild-covid-symptoms).

These things don’t happen in all cases. Nor do other long term complications reported by patients who have long since “recovered”. Not every person will suffer long term disability. Not even most people. But ”not even most people” out of the 3 million infected Americans is a huge number.

I’m not a completely healthy person. I have autoimmune issues. I could have a serious reaction to a coronavirus infection. But beyond that, I’m not a gambler. Yes, if infected I might have a mild reaction to the virus; but I might not. Do I want to gamble with my life on the odds? I can’t afford to be sick. I can’t afford to suffer a long-term disability that prevents me from working. And I don’t want risk the health of my family members.

So yeah, I’m afraid of COVID-19. I’m not comfortable with the odds of a “mild case”. The cost of losing that bet is way too high. For as long as I’m able, I’ll sit this hand out.
