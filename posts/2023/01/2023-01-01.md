<span class="dropcap">I</span>t might be the end of the road for my Early 2013 MacBook Pro. I have been trying to update some homebrew casks on my machine so I can work on some projects (11ty, ddev). There have been problems updating node, so I tried a `brew reinstall node` and received this message:

“We (and Apple) do not provide support for this old version. It is expected behaviour that some formulae will fail to build in this old version. It is expected behaviour that Homebrew will be buggy and slow.”

I have been holding out for a while for a new laptop (obviously -- it has been nearly 11 years) but this might be a sign that I can’t put it off any more.
