title: About Blogging

I’ve had accounts with Facebook and with Twitter for a long time. I used to see a lot of value in being able to connect with people through social media, but these platforms have become a cancer on civil society. They serve as a megaphone for lies. The allow hate erode the foundations decency. Rumors, innuendo, and conspiracy theories are allowed to stand on equal footing with the truth.

It has only become worse since the COVID-19 pandemic. I cannot in good conscience continue to support these plaforms by using them. So I’ve initiated the cancellation of my accounts.

I used to have a blog – years ago, before work and family began to take up more time. It was a fun project and it gave me the opportunity to practice developing with WordPress. The blog also made me exercise my writing skills. When I gave up my blog it was under the assumption that social media would provide a replacement outlet for my ideas and writing – without all the extra code. For a little while, it did.

Now I’ll go back to blogging.

## The Static Site Generation of Blogging

SSG is cool right now. I always wanted to be one of the cool kids, so I’m going to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/?s=eleventy&orderby=relevance&post_type=post%2Cpage%2Cguide">copycat CSS-Tricks’ Chris Coyier</a> and start working with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>. A statically generated site can be served from basically anywhere.

## Fast Blog Design

I’m not going to bother trying to design this. I picked out a couple of Google Fonts (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter?query=bitter#standard-styles">Bitter</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Changa+One?query=changa#standard-styles">Changa One</a>), applied the stylesheet from <a href="http://aaronpinero.com/tyfy/docs/index.html">TYFY</a>, and threw together some additional CSS. I didn’t even bother with SASS. I just want to start blogging.
