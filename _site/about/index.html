  <h1 class="page-title">About Blogging</h1> 
  <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>’ve been on Facebook and Twitter for a long time. I used to see value in connecting with people through social media. But these platforms have become a cancer inside civil society. They are megaphones for lies. The allow hate to erode the foundations of decency. Rumors, innuendo, and conspiracy theories are allowed to stand on equal footing with the truth.</p>
<p>It has only become worse since the COVID-19 pandemic. I cannot in good conscience continue to support these plaforms by using them. So I’ve initiated the cancellation of my accounts.</p>
<p>I had a blog – years ago, before work and family began to take up more time. It was a fun project and it gave me the opportunity to practice developing with WordPress. Blogging also exercised my writing skills. When I gave up my blog it was under the assumption that social media would provide a replacement outlet for my ideas and writing – without all the extra code. For a little while, it did.</p>
<p>Now I’ll go back to blogging.</p>
