  <h1 class="page-title">About Blogging</h1> 
  <p>I’ve had accounts with Facebook and with Twitter for a long time. I used to see a lot of value in being able to connect with people through social media, but these platforms have become a cancer on civil society. They serve as a megaphone for lies. The allow hate erode the foundations decency. Rumors, innuendo, and conspiracy theories are allowed to stand on equal footing with the truth.</p>
<p>It has only become worse since the COVID-19 pandemic. I cannot in good conscience continue to support these plaforms by using them. So I’ve initiated the cancellation of my accounts.</p>
<p>I used to have a blog – years ago, before work and family began to take up more time. It was a fun project and it gave me the opportunity to practice developing with WordPress. The blog also made me exercise my writing skills. When I gave up my blog it was under the assumption that social media would provide a replacement outlet for my ideas and writing – without all the extra code. For a little while, it did.</p>
<p>Now I’ll go back to blogging.</p>
<h2>The Static Site Generation of Blogging</h2>
<p>SSG is cool right now. I always wanted to be one of the cool kids, so I’m going to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/?s=eleventy&orderby=relevance&post_type=post%2Cpage%2Cguide">copycat CSS-Tricks’ Chris Coyier</a> and start working with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>. A statically generated site can be served from basically anywhere.</p>
<h2>Fast Blog Design</h2>
<p>I’m not going to bother trying to design this. I picked out a couple of Google Fonts (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter?query=bitter#standard-styles">Bitter</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Changa+One?query=changa#standard-styles">Changa One</a>), applied the stylesheet from <a href="http://aaronpinero.com/tyfy/docs/index.html">TYFY</a>, and threw together some additional CSS. I didn’t even bother with SASS. I just want to start blogging.</p>
