  <p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ritten communication was never my strength. I was always best when there was a problem to solve that had a single correct answer. The &quot;liberal arts&quot; are where I need extra focus and the most practice in order to produce anything of a reasonable quality.</p>
<p>I occasionally use a journal to organize my thoughts, but a journal is an internal conversation. Writing a blog, like designing an interface, is communication â€“ a conversation one has with an audience. A journal entry need only make sense to my future self. A blog post or a visual design needs to make sense to everyone else. Blogging helps me practice my written conversation skills, hopefully making me a better writer.</p>
<p>But what to write about? Communication requires having something to say. They say you should write what you know. For this project, I've decided to write about what I just learned.</p>
<p>This blog is dedicated to interesting information. I should always be learning, so there should always be concepts, ideas, trivia or experiences for me to share.</p>
