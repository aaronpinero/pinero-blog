<p>Elsevier provides two ways to query Scopus for journal article records: a web interface and an API. The API does not include raw author affiliation data. The web interface will allow you to export search results data that includes the author affiliations but omits publication dates. So there doesn't seem to be a way to retrieve records from Scopus that include both raw affiliation data and publication dates.</p>
