<p>I rode a stationary bike this morning for my workout instead of going outside to ride because of snow and salt and wind and sub-freezing temperatures so my hands and feet were nice and toasty but <em>damn</em> it sucked. I could use some warmer weather (just a little warmer) or a real solution to frozen toes.</p>
