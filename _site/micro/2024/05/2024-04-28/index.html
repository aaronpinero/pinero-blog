<p>The user experience of shopping for Whole Foods delivery is the absolute worst. Particularly on the mobile app. If I am shopping for Whole Foods delivery, I don't want my searches to return results from all of Amazon. This is the most frustrating online shopping experience I've ever had from any online grocery service. Someone at Amazon must know it's bad.</p>
