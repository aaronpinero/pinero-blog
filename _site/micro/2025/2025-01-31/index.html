<p>Okay, a piece of really poor UX design is driving me mad: in the Apple Music app, I cannot tell, just by looking at it, if the &quot;Favorite&quot; button is showing that I have 'favorited' the song or not. Worse, I think the button has a different appearance depending on whether or not you are in the app or in the control center. It is a little trivial detail in a very big app but it is nettlesome.</p>
