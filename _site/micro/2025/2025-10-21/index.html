<p>Apple should create an Apple Watch face that mimics the seven segment displays on old digital watches. It would be a cool retro look that I think would be popular with people of a certain age who fondly remember the Casio they once had when then were younger. It's odd to me that Apple has spent their effort on Apple Watch faces that are based on traditional round designs but have not created even one face that celebrates early digital displays. I bet they could make one that looks really attractive.</p>
