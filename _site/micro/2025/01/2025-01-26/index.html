<p>If I am using ChatGPT or Google Gemini or GitHub Copilot to get answers to code questions or examples of code – which I always check against documentation before using – am I learning new code techniques in the process? Or do these tools serve as a crutch that will ultimately make me a weaker programmer?</p>
