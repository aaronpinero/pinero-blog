<p>Just watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN28jGiRhBA">demo of Drupal UI Suite</a> that was presented at the Asheville Drupal Camp and itâ€™s really exciting. I now feel like I need to revise my early attempts at Single Directory Components and figure out how to incorporate UI Suite into my sites. Drupal is really growing up and the site building experience is going to be just as good as other CMSs. That said, the interface for using UI Suite with blocks, fields, and views needs some help from a UX expert.</p>
