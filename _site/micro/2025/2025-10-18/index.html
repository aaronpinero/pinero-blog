<p>Never buy a GoPro camera. Full stop. Their app is garbage. Their customer service is non-existent. And their camera batteries have a very, very short life. I had one fail a couple of months (!) into owning a GoPro Hero 12, and another one just failed on me today, no warning. Missed recording an epic autumn bike ride because of it. When I contacted GoPro about the first battery failure, they ignored me. Well, I've had it. They suck. This is my first experience owning an action camera and I will never buy another product from them as a result. I look with envy at people I know with Insta cameras, particularly the Insta 360.</p>
