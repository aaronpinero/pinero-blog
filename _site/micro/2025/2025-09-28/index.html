<p>I cannot understand all the hate being directed at <i>Alien: Earth</i>. This is some of the best television I’ve seen in quite some time and a wonderful addition to the <i>Alien</i> franchise. I loved the season finale and foundation that has been established for a next season — I have to assume a show this excellent will get a second season. I tell anyone who likes the <i>Alien</i> movies — or the sci-fi horror genre more generally — that this is worth watching. I am excited to see where this story goes.</p>
