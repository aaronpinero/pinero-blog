  </header>
  <p><span class="dropcap">I</span> woke up this morning and checked out my YouTube feed as I always do. But today instead of the usual nonsense about Apple (going to fail), the coronavirus (we’re going to fail) or politics (democracy is going to fail), I came across a video about something called the Holy Albatross invented by Heydon Pickering. If you’ve read my documentation about Tyfy, you know I already admire Heydon and his work. But this new concept – the Holy Albatross – is a facinating approach to web page layout achieved by ‘hacking’ CSS to create logic rules.</p>
<p>I’m not going to try to explain it here. Heydon has done so well enough, and with more wit, in <a href="https://heydonworks.com/article/the-flexbox-holy-albatross/">an article on his website</a> and also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf09FFZYwoo">in this video from beyond tellerrand</a>.</p>
<p>In the video, he explains the idea behind and the execution of the Holy Albatross. Beyond that, however, Heydon introduces the concept of ‘algorithmic’ layout and introduces a video series he is working on to explore the idea.</p>
