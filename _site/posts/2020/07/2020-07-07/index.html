    <h1 class="post-title">About Documentation Being Hard</h1> 
  </header>
  <p><span class="dropcap">D</span>ocumentation is hard. I know this from trying to document my <a href="http://aaronpinero.net/tyfy/docs/index.html">Tyfy</a> framework. Documentation must be a skill that some individuals are born with. Maybe it is honed through years of practice. Perhaps it requires a gifted teacher. I don’t think I have the necessary skill. I’m not a gifted teacher. I was never a very good writer — I gave fits to one of my high school English teachers.</p>
<p>I often encounter bad documentation. Okay, maybe not “bad” but difficult for me. The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation">Drupal documentation</a> is an example. I think poor documentation is one of the reasons why Drupal is not as popular as WordPress. Drupal documentation is a mix of incomplete and opaque. It requires the reader to have experience as a programmer. I’ve acquired a little of that experience, so maybe that’s why I think it’s gotten better. But it still has a lot of holes and rough patches. There are places where people clearly haven’t put in the time. I understand that documenting Drupal is volunteer work. But the problem limits the adoption and popularity of Drupal outside the hard-core enthusiasts. They have the technical wherewithal to power through difficult documentation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/">documentation for Eleventy</a> got on my nerves today. First, the design is terrible. The font and color choices make parsing the documentation pages unnecessarily difficult. They need to take some cues from the <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html">Nunchucks documentation</a> — a relative oasis of clarity. Eleventy is also new and simple. There are very few practical examples available. It’s not clear where it would be best to use Eleventy, a templating engine, or JavaScript to solve a technical problem. Something as simple as displaying the full text of the latest post on a page took an extraordinary amount of time to research. This seems like a pretty simple use case and my solution feels like a hack. I am left with the sense that Eleventy can get you up and running quickly if your needs are simple; beyond that, good luck. The documentation may or may not help you.</p>
<p>Good documentation takes time. I know I’ve rarely put in the requisite time and effort, so it’s hypocritical for me to ask others to do the same. But I know that others will be more likely to use the things I’ve built if I could provide good documentation. Likewise, everyone will be more happy to use tools like Drupal and Eleventy if the documentation were more accessible.</p>
