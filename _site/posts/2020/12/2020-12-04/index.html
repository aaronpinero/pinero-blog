    <h1 class="post-title">About placeholder text in Firefox</h1> 
  </header>
  <p><span class="dropcap">S</span>earch is an important function of the website I support as Web Services Manager. Recently, several colleages were telling me that the placeholder text in the search bar of our website was really very light – maybe too light. I knew the color probably didn’t meet the WCAG color contrast standard, but I felt it was still legible on both my laptop and my crummy old Dell external display.</p>
<p>Still, in respect for their opinion and the fact that search is very important to us, I decided to increase the contrast to a minimally acceptable level for accessibility – a contrast ratio of about 3:1. In addition, I made an effort to review the updated color in several browsers. I didn’t think this was strictly necessary – all browsers should display color in the same way on the same screen, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>To my surprise, the placeholder text in the search bar was much, much lighter in Firefox. The color defined in our stylesheet is <code>#7a7f85</code>, but the color being displayed in Firefox (as checked by inspecting a screen capture in Pixelmator Pro) was more like <code>#b7babd</code>. That’s a huge difference, particularly for accessibility. What is up with that? I did a quick search for information about color display difference between Firefox and other browsers, but came up empty. Then I searched specifically for Firefox placeholder text color. The result was <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19621306/css-placeholder-text-color-on-firefox">this Stack Overflow question</a>. For some reason, the default opacity of placeholder text in a Firefox input field is not equal to 1. You have to specify <code>opacity:1</code> in your stylesheet to make placeholder text in Firefox match appearance with that in Edge or Safari.</p>
<p>This is a really annoying quirk of Firefox.</p>
