  <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>his year I decided it was time to update <a href="http://aaronpinero.net/tyfy/docs/index.html">Tyfy</a>, my old web framework that I haven't really touched since 2021. Since then I've grown and improved as a developer and there have been many advances in front-end development. Time to put all of it to use.</p>
<p>For this update, I've decided to abandon <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>. While I still use it in my regular work, building and maintaining Drupal themes, I think its days are numbered. CSS has become so good, so capable in the last few years that SASS is no longer necessary. The biggest reason I still need to use it at all is that Bootstrap 5 still uses it. But for how much longer? I wonder…</p>
<p>The challenge for my update of Tyfy is figuring out how to replace some of the custom SASS functions I wrote. I worried that one of the more complicated functions I wrote, for calculating a grid-based line height given a font size, would be extremely difficult to replace.</p>
<p>And then I discovered <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions/Using_CSS_math_functions">CSS Math</a>.</p>
<p>I don't know how long I've been ignorant of this, but now I know. To be fair, I already knew about calc() and min() and max() and clamp(). But the Advanced CSS Math functions blow my mind. I'm only beginning to wrap my head around how I might make use of these, but one of them has already made life so much easier.</p>
<p>For calculating grid-based line heights, I can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/round">round() function</a>. Now, rounding is a very simple and well understood idea, but the round function has an interesting trick to it. Instead of just giving the function a value and telling it to round up or down, the function accepts a value to use as a rounding interval. I think this is very powerful. You can tell the function <em>how</em> to round, and you're not limited to integer values.</p>
<p>I can now calculate a grid-based line height for any font size just like this:</p>
<p><code>line-height: round(up, var(--font-size), var(--grid-unit));</code></p>
<p>In this example, <code>--font-size</code> and <code>--grid-unit</code> are CSS custom properties with rem unit values. The resulting line-height will be a rem value that conforms to the baseline grid established in my framework.</p>
<p>I am very excited by how my update project is going and I cannot wait for whatever new CSS discoveries I might make as I move away from SASS.</p>
