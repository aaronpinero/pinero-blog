  <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t has been a long, long time since I implemented drop-down menus for a website. In my last job, all the websites had them and there was well-used code that we applied to this problem. But that was in the <em>before times</em>. In 2023, how does one go about creating drop-down (fly-out, some say) menus for a website if you’re not automatically going to fall back on a framework or a library?</p>
<p>I remember, several years back, one of the developers I worked with attempted to do this with no/minimal JavaScript by using the <code>:focus-within</code> pseudo-class. At the time, this was a relatively new approach that was not supported in all cases. The attempt was abandoned in favor of our “tried-and-true” implementation, but I did not forget the attractiveness of a possible CSS-only solution. Today, with the pending need for dropdown menus on websites in my current job, I decided to give it another go.</p>
<p>My initial attempt was as shown in the CodePen below. The website for which I am developing this menu is based on Drupal, so the HTML for the menu is an unordered list of links inside a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element. Drop-down menus are nested unordered lists. Clicking on a top level option places the focus on the link; CSS styles for the list item containing the link use the <code>:focus-within</code> pseudo-class to display the nested unordered list which is hidden by default.</p>
<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="RwBEeda" data-user="aaronpinero" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

<p>In Firefox, this simple implementation works fine. However, it fails in Safari, and I cannot figure out why. In Safari v16, if you open the developer tools and force the :focus-within state on the list item, the dropdown will appear. But either the link will not capture focus when clicked or the focus on the link does not trigger the :focus-within state on the list item.</p>
<p>There is a fix for this. If I add the attribute <code>tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;</code> to the link, then everything functions correctly.</p>
<hr>
<p>I wish that had been the end of the story.</p>
<p>Accessibility of this approach is a concern. I want to make sure that our website have accessible dropdown menus. A brief Google search resulted in a few articles describing how to create accessible dropdown menus:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/en/articles/dropdown-menu/">Dropdown menu example</a> from Orange Digital Accessibility</li>
<li><a href="https://moderncss.dev/css-only-accessible-dropdown-navigation-menu/">CSS-Only Accessible Dropdown Navigation Menu</a> by Stephanie Eckles</li>
<li><a href="https://codepen.io/srirachachacha/pen/VPKjjx">Accessible Dropdown Menus</a> by Tristan Wilson</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples of accessible dropdowns all use a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element as the trigger for the menu. As I understand it, a button is more semantically correct in this instance and provides a better user experience to users browsing with the help of various assistive technologies. So I replaced the link in my example with a button.</p>
<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="xxJmmzp" data-user="aaronpinero" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

<p>Unfortunately, Safari once again has a problem. Here I thought a button element should be more agreeable for capturing focus and triggering the <code>:focus-within</code> state on the parent list item element. Instead, the situation is worse. I cannot get the button to show the dropdown in Safari, no matter what attributes I add.</p>
<p>For now, I am going to try using a link with the <code>tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;</code> and <code>role=&quot;button&quot;</code> attributes to see if that will provide the desired level of accessibility. However, it would be nice if Safari would simply handle the <code>:focus-within</code> state as well as Firefox does.</p>
<p>And no, I have not even tried Chrome yet. *sigh*</p>
