<p>The Purple Owl Dispensary is a woman-owned adult-use legal cannabis dispensary in New York State catering to a suburban population. The client aimed to establish a brand that would be inviting to older, female, and inexperienced cannabis consumers. Key ideas included traditional, down-to-earth, homey, warm, comfortable, and nature.</p>

<p>The client provided concept owl illustrations that were the basis for the final mark. Several typefaces and color schemes were evaluated before the brand elements were finalized.</p>
<h2>Web Design</h2>
<p>Design began with an exploration of textures and the creation of original illustrated elements. These were used to craft a home page concept. The home page concept was not implemented in full, but some of the graphic elements and textures were incorporated into other work.</p>
