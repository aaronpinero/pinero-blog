<p>Jeffrey Hoffman is one of the most influential experts in the New York State legal cannabis market. He runs the law firm Jeffrey Hoffman & Associates, hosts a weekly AMA on LinkedIn, and both hosts and participates in numerous events. The identity for his legal practice needed to be formal and professional with a classy cannabis flavor.</p>

<p>During development of the logo mark, the following illustration was created to reimagine the traditional cannabis leaf shape with a more formal and professional character. The client liked the visual enough that it was incorporated in future design work. While not part of the logo, it is an essential part of the brand.</p>

<h2>Print & Web</h2>
