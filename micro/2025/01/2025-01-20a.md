Does <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> really require you to be building an app from some sort of framework? Is there no vanilla HTML/CSS implementation? What an immediate turn-off. I was considering replacing <a href="https://fractal.build">Fractal</a> (which might no longer be maintained?) but hard pass on Storybook.
