Was reading about CSS <code>text-box</code> (from Friday Front-End) and I can see isolated cases where it would be useful. But <a href="/tyfy/docs/index.html">my own framework</a> is all about creating a useful baseline grid. Using <code>text-box</code> would seem to make that an impossible goal. Iâ€™m not a fan.
