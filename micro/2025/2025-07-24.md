The design of Apple’s ’26 operating systems is like the Cybertruck. They designed themselves into a corner and had to create fancy technical solutions to problems that they made for themselves. It might have been better if they considered legibility, accessibility, and usability up front instead of “it needs to look like glass”. Instead, they seem to be doubling down on a concept that they will eventually scrap when it inevitably turns out to be unsuccessful because it is unpopular.
