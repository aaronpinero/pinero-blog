Google’s solution for the camera bump on their Pixel phones is much better than what Apple does on the iPhone. The Pixel is stable on a flat surface. The iPhone is awkward and wobbles. I don’t understand how Apple continues to ignore these little practical details. The hardware design continues to lag behind the software design when it comes to considering the user and everyday use.
