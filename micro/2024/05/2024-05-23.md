A device that is a combination laptop and tablet still tends to have compromises that make it either not a good laptop or not a good tablet. This is, I imagine, Apple's central argument for the division between the iPad and the Mac. The Mac can focus on being the best possible laptop and the iPad can focus on being the best possible tablet. But I think the hardware is getting to the point where an uncompromised combined device may soon be possible. Apple silicon hints at this.
