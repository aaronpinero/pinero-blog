I have my criticisms of Apple hardware naming schemes (“The New iPad”, anyone?) but at least their processor designations are very clear. M1, M2, etc. Regular, Pro, Max, and Ultra. I cannot say the same about Intel Crater Lake or Snowball Lake or Jupiter Lake or whatever they come out with year after year. Or Ryzen 4600 Zen 3 vs 7700 Zen 5 or whatever they call it. As if they try to confuse consumers.
