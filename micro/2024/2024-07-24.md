A Brompton bicycle in the city is a common sight nowadays, but in the burbs where I live it is still a novelty. It often happens that someone, usually a woman over the age of 55, will come up to me to ask questions about and admire my bike. Always makes me smile. I am happy to tell them about my British folding bike.
